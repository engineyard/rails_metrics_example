== Rails Metrics

This an example app using Rails Metrics gem for Rails 3.0.

== Get it running

Since it relies on Rails 3.0 edge, which is vendored, you need the following steps to make this example work (while Rails 3.0 is not released):

  git submodule update --init
  cd vendor/rails

  # Install bundler
  sudo gem install bundler

  # If you don't have mysql or postgresql installed, comment them on the Gemfile
  vim Gemfile
  gem bundle

That's it, have fun!
