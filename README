== RailsMetrics example

This is an application that showcases RailsMetrics:

  http://github.com/engineyard/rails_metrics

To get it running, do:

  1) Take a look to config/database.yml and see if it points to the proper mysql socket

  2) bundle install

  3) rake db:create & rake db:migrate

  4) rails server

Access the home page of the application and navigate a little on your application. When you are done, access "/rails_metrics" to see some metrics.

Enjoy!
